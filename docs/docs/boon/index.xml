    <title>Boon :: Hotel California of Creative Writing</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/hccw/docs/boon/</link>
    <description>Introduction Boon is a modal editing package for Emacs that is ergonomic and designed to integrate well with existing Emacs infrastructure. That means that we can continue to use the standard Emacs keyboard shortcuts should we choose to do so, in addition to the features that Boon provides.&#xA;Boon is designed so that the right hand takes care of movement, and the left hand do the actions. And great care is taken to ensure that the fingers never leave the home row. Important for touch typists!</description>
