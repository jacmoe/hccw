    <title>Emacs :: Hotel California of Creative Writing</title>
    <link>https://jacmoe.github.io/hccw/docs/emacs/</link>
    <description>Introduction “I use emacs, which might be thought of as a thermonuclear word processor… the engineer-hours that, in the case of Microsoft Word, were devoted to features like mail merge, and the ability to embed feature-length motion pictures in corporate memoranda, were, in the case of emacs, focused with maniacal intensity on the deceptively simple-seeming problem of editing text. If you are a professional writer… emacs outshines all other editing software in approximately the same way that the noonday sun does the stars. It is not just bigger and brighter; it simply makes everything else vanish.”</description>
