![Hotel California of Creative Writing](/images/hotel-california.png?width=100%&height=100%)

This is a detailed explanation of why Emacs is my Hotel California of creative writing. It shows how I have created a writing environment exactly how I want it to be, and why there—in my mind—is nothing out there that compares to it.

<br/>

Perhaps when you think of Emacs, you think of it as a text editor and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

<br/>

It is my hope that, after reading this article, that  you start thinking of it as an Integrated Writing Environment (IWE) as well.
